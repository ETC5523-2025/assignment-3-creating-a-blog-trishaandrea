    "text": "I’m currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Management at Prasetiya Mulya University, where I developed a strong foundation in business and management.\nProfessionally, I have gained experience in customer service, hospitality, and branding consulting, which allowed me to apply my management background in practical settings. Alongside this, I run a small online business, where I continue to develop my skills in entrepreneurship and digital marketing.\nBeyond my studies, I am passionate about exploring new places, cultures, and perspectives through travel. I also enjoy baking, discovering coffee spots, and sharing insights about education, lifestyle, and living abroad."

Characteristics of the three study sites (adapted from Kermorvant et al., 2023)."

    "text": "Methods: A Two-Step Modelling Approach\nTo answer the question, researchers combined two statistical tools:\n\nGeneralised Additive Model (GAM)\n\nHandles curved, non-linear relationships.\n\nFor example, nitrate might increase with temperature up to a point, then level off.\n\nARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)\n\nA time-series model that captures cycles and patterns over time.\n\nAccounts for daily (diel) and seasonal changes in rivers.\n\n\nTogether, this two-step model explained ~99% of nitrate variation across all sites.\nIn simple terms:\n- GAMs captured how sensor values relate to nitrate.\n- ARIMA filled in the predictable time-based patterns that the GAM couldn’t."

    "section": "Why This Matters for Managers",
    "text": "Why This Matters for Managers\nThis study has big practical implications:\n\n✅ Cheaper monitoring → If nitrate sensors fail or are too expensive, managers can rely on common sensors already deployed in rivers.\n\n✅ Filling gaps → Models can reconstruct nitrate when data are missing, such as during frozen winters in Alaska.\n\n✅ Scalable approach → The same framework worked in three very different rivers, suggesting it can be applied widely.\n\n✅ Decision support → Agencies can focus resources on a core set of sensors rather than expensive extras."

    "section": "Limitations",
    "text": "Limitations\nOf course, no study is perfect.\n\n⚠ Not a universal model → Each site needs its own fitted version; transferability is about the framework, not the coefficients.\n\n⚠ Data gaps → Frozen rivers, dry periods, and sensor outages reduce usable data.\n\n⚠ Computational load → Large datasets take time to model.\n\n⚠ Site-specific importance → While the same variables matter everywhere, their strength differs by site."

    "text": "Conclusion\nA simple two-step model using cheap sensor data can explain nearly all nitrate variation across rivers in very different climates.\nThe key message is clear: with the right models, managers don’t always need expensive nitrate sensors to keep rivers healthy.\nThis makes monitoring:\n- Cheaper\n- More reliable\n- More adaptable\nAnd most importantly, it helps protect ecosystems that depend on clean, well-monitored water."
