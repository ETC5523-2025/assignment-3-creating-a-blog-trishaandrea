    "section": "Why Nitrate Monitoring Matters",
    "text": "Why Nitrate Monitoring Matters\nNitrate is essential for aquatic life, but too much causes algal blooms and oxygen crashes, harming fish and river health.\nManagers usually rely on expensive nitrate sensors, which can fail or be too costly to use everywhere. This raises the key question:\nCan cheaper, widely available sensors provide reliable nitrate information across different rivers?"

    "section": "The Data",
    "text": "The Data\nWe used two years of high-frequency monitoring data from three US rivers (Kermorvant et al., 2023):\n\nArikaree River (Colorado): semi-arid, agriculture affected.\n\nCaribou Creek (Alaska): subarctic, frozen in winter.\n\nLewis Run (Virginia): temperate, urban + agricultural mix.\n\nThe dataset included nitrate (every 15 minutes) plus cheap sensors: temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and water level.\nFaulty readings and missing data were removed before modelling. This ensured the analysis reflected only reliable sensor information."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis study shows that common sensors (temperature, oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, water level) can reliably monitor nitrate when combined with GAM + ARIMA models.\nMonitoring can be cheaper and more resilient.\nModels can fill gaps when expensive nitrate sensors fail.\nA single framework can scale across diverse river systems.\nFor water managers, the message is clear: you don’t always need costly nitrate sensors to protect river health."
