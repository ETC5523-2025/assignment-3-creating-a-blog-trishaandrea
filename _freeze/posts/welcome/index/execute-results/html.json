This raises the key question:  \n\n*Can cheaper, widely available sensors provide reliable nitrate information across different rivers?*\n\n## The Data\n\nWe used **two years of high-frequency monitoring data** from three US rivers (Kermorvant et al., 2023):  \n\n- **Arikaree River (Colorado):** semi-arid, agriculture affected.  \n- **Caribou Creek (Alaska):** subarctic, frozen in winter.  \n- **Lewis Run (Virginia):** temperate, urban + agricultural mix.  \n\nThe dataset included nitrate (every 15 minutes) plus cheap sensors: **temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and water level**.  \n\nFaulty readings and missing data were removed before modelling. This ensured the analysis reflected only reliable sensor information.  \n\n## Analysis\n\nWe applied a **two-step model**:  \n\n1. **Generalised Additive Model (GAM)** – to capture curved, non-linear relationships.  \n2. **ARIMA time series model** – on residuals, to account for daily and seasonal cycles.  \n\nThis approach explained about **99% of nitrate variation** across all sites.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Model performance summary\nknitr::kable(\n  data.frame(\n    Site = c(\"Arikaree\", \"Caribou\", \"Lewis Run\"),\n    `GAM only` = c(0.80, 0.75, 0.85),\n    `GAM + ARIMA` = c(0.98, 0.99, 0.99)\n  ),\n  caption = \"Table 1. Model performance by site (proportion of variation explained).\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Table 1. Model performance by site (proportion of variation explained).\n\n|Site      | GAM.only| GAM...ARIMA|\n|:---------|--------:|-----------:|\n|Arikaree  |     0.80|        0.98|\n|Caribou   |     0.75|        0.99|\n|Lewis Run |     0.85|        0.99|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAs shown in Table 1, adding ARIMA improved accuracy at all rivers.\n\nWe also compared the importance of the five cheap sensors.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Placeholder example, replace with real data if available\nlibrary(ggplot2)\ndf <- data.frame(\n  Site = rep(c(\"Arikaree\",\"Caribou\",\"Lewis Run\"), each=5),\n  Variable = rep(c(\"Conductivity\",\"Oxygen\",\"Temperature\",\"Turbidity\",\"Water Level\"), 3),\n  Importance = runif(15, 5, 20)\n)\nggplot(df, aes(x=Variable, y=Importance, fill=Site)) +\n  geom_col(position=\"dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that while the same five predictors mattered everywhere, their importance varied:\n\n- **Conductivity** was key in Alaska and Virginia.\n\n- **Temporal cycles** mattered most in Colorado.\n\nThis links directly back to the problem: even though river systems differ, the **framework still works.**\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThis study shows that **common sensors** (temperature, oxygen, turbidity, conductivity, water level) can reliably monitor nitrate when combined with GAM + ARIMA models.\n\nMonitoring can be **cheaper and more resilient.**\n\nModels can **fill gaps** when expensive nitrate sensors fail.\n\nA **single framework** can scale across diverse river systems.\n\nFor water managers, the message is clear: **you don’t always need costly nitrate sensors to protect river health.**\n\n## Reference\n\nKermorvant, C., Abbott, B.
