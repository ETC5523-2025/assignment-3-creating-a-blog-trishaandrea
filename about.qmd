I’m currently pursuing my Master of Business Analytics at Monash University in Melbourne. My academic journey began with a Bachelor’s degree in Management at Prasetiya Mulya University, where I developed a strong foundation in business and management.

Professionally, I have gained experience in customer service, hospitality, and branding consulting, which allowed me to apply my management background in practical settings. Alongside this, I run a small online business, where I continue to develop my skills in entrepreneurship and digital marketing.

Beyond my studies, I am passionate about exploring new places, cultures, and perspectives through travel. I also enjoy baking, discovering coffee spots, and sharing insights about education, lifestyle, and living abroad.
